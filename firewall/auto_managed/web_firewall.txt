This script (as is) allows to controll SSH access on firewall. We allow one IP to have
SSH granted for 3 days.

Idea: Firewall is divided to 3 parts: 
- header
- SSH allowed IPs
- footer
Both header and footer are static files; includes defined policy. 

Header example:
*filter
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -d 127.0.0.0/8 -i eth0 -j DROP
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -m comment --comment "allow ICMP (including ping)" -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m comment --comment "allow Nginx" -j ACCEPT

Footer example:
COMMIT

(yes, just word "COMMIT")
Those are iptables-restore - ready files. Between them, we put IPs for which SSH access will be allowed.
This part will be changed during time; since we have some users comming and going. So, for one allowed IP
there will be a rule:

-A INPUT -s 192.168.0.13 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

How to manage those IPs? It is simple. All you have to do is create a file: 
/var/www/web_firewall/192.168.0.13.ACTIVE
That file can contain the date of it's creation, like: "1981-12-13 06:00:00"

Firewall script is checking every 15 seconds for new IPs. If any IP will be added or removed,
firewall will be recreated and new rules will be established.
